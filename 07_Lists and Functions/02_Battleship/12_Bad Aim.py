Bad Aim
Great job! Now we can handle both correct and incorrect guesses from the user. But now let’s think a little bit more about the "miss" condition.

They can enter a guess that's off the board.
They can guess a spot they’ve already guessed.
They can just miss the ship.
We'll add these tests inside our else condition. Let's build the first case now!

if x not in range(8) or \
   y not in range(3):
        print "Outside the range"
The example above checks if either x or y are outside those ranges. The \ character just continues the if statement onto the next line.

Instructions
Add a new if: statement that is nested under the else.
Like the example above, it should check if guess_row is not in range(5) or guess_col is not in range(5).
If that is the case, print out "Oops, that's not even in the ocean."
After your new if: statement, add an else: that contains your existing handler for an incorrect guess. Don't forget to indent the code!
