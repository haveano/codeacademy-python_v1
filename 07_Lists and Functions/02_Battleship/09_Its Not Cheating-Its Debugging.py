It's Not Cheatingâ€”It's Debugging!
Awesome! Now we have a hidden battleship and a guess from our player. In the next few steps, we'll check the user's guess to see if they are correct.

While we're writing and debugging this part of the program, it will be helpful to know where that battleship is hidden. Let's add a print statement that displays the location of the hidden ship.

Of course, we'll remove this output when we're finished debugging since if we left it in, our game wouldn't be very challenging. :)

Instructions
Print the value of ship_col.
Print the value of ship_row.
