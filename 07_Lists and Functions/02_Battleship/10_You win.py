"""
You win!
Okayâ€”now for the fun! We have the actual location of the ship and the player's guess so we can check to see if the player guessed right.

For a guess to be right, guess_col should be equal to ship_col and guess_row should be equal to ship_row.

if guess_col == 0 and guess_row == 0:
    print "Top-left corner."
The example above is just a reminder about if statements.

Instructions
On line 29, add an if guess_row equals ship_row and guess_col equals ship_col.
If that is the case, please print out "Congratulations! You sank my battleship!"
