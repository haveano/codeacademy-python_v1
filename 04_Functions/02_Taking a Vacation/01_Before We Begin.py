Before We Begin
Let's first quickly review functions in Python.

def bigger(first, second):
    print max(first, second)
    return True
In the example above:

We define a function called bigger that has two arguments called first and second.
Then, we print out the larger of the two arguments using the built-in function max.
Finally, the bigger function returns True.
Now try creating a function yourself!

Instructions
Write a function called answer that takes no arguments and returns the value 42.

Even without arguments, you will still need parentheses.

Don't forget the colon at the end of the function definition!

"""

def answer():
    return 42

answer()
#print answer()
