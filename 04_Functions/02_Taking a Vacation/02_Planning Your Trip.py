Planning Your Trip
When planning a vacation, it's very important to know exactly how much you're going to spend.

def wages(hours):
    # If I make $8.35/hour...
    return 8.35 * hours
The above example is just a refresher in how functions are defined.

Let's use functions to calculate your trip's costs.

Instructions
Define a function called hotel_cost with one argument nights as input.
The hotel costs $140 per night. So, the function hotel_cost should return 140 * nights.

def hotel_cost(nights):
    return 140*nights
