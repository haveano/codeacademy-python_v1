Function Imports
Nice work! Now Python knows how to take the square root of a number.

However, we only really needed the sqrt function, and it can be frustrating to have to keep typing math.sqrt().

It's possible to import only certain variables or functions from a given module. Pulling in just a single function from a module is called a function import, and it's done with the from keyword:

from module import function
Now you can just type sqrt() to get the square root of a numberâ€”no more math.sqrt()!

Instructions
Let's import only the sqrt function from math this time. (You don't need the () after sqrt in the from math import sqrt bit.)

# Import *just* the sqrt function from math on line 3!
from math import sqrt
