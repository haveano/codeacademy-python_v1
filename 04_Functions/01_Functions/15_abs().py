abs()
The abs() function returns the absolute value of the number it takes as an argumentâ€”that is, that number's distance from 0 on an imagined number line. For instance, 3 and -3 both have the same absolute value: 3. The abs() function always returns a positive value, and unlike max() and min(), it only takes a single number.

Instructions
Set absolute equal to the absolute value of -42 on line 2.

absolute = abs(-42)
