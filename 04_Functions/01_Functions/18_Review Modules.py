Review: Modules
Good work! Now let's see what you remember about importing modules (and, specifically, what's available in the math module).

Import the math module in whatever way you prefer. Call its sqrt function on the number 13689 and print that value to the console.
"""

from math import sqrt
#import math from sqrt 

print sqrt(13689)
