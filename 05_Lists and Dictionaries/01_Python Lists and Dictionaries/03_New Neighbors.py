New Neighbors
A list index behaves like any other variable name! It can be used to access as well as assign values.

You saw how to access a list index like this:

zoo_animals[0]
# Gets the value "pangolin"
You can see how assignment works on line 5:

zoo_animals[2] = "hyena"
# Changes "sloth" to "hyena"
Instructions
Write an assignment statement that will replace the item that currently holds the value "tiger" with another animal (as a string). It can be any animal you like.
"""

zoo_animals = ["pangolin", "cassowary", "sloth", "tiger"]
# Last night our zoo's sloth brutally attacked 
#the poor tiger and ate it whole.

# The ferocious sloth has been replaced by a friendly hyena.
zoo_animals[2] = "hyena"

# What shall fill the void left by our dear departed tiger?
# Your code here!
zoo_animals[3]="pegeon"
