It's Dangerous to Go Alone! Take This
Let's go over a few last notes about dictionaries

my_dict = {
    "fish": ["c", "a", "r", "p"],
    "cash": -4483,
    "luck": "good"
}
print my_dict["fish"][0]
In the example above, we created a dictionary that holds many types of values.
The key "fish" has a list, the key "cash" has an int, and the key "luck" has a string.
Finally, we print the letter 'c'. When we access a value in the dictionary like my_dict["fish"], we have direct access to that value. So we can access the item at index '0' in the list stored by the key "fish"
Instructions
Add a key to inventory called 'pocket'
Set the value of 'pocket' to be a list consisting of the strings 'seashell', 'strange berry', and 'lint'
.sort() the items in the list stored under the 'backpack' key
Then .remove('dagger') from the list of items stored under the 'backpack' key
Add 50 to the number stored under the 'gold' key
