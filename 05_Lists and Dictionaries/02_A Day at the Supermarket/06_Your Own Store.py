"""
Your Own Store!
Okayâ€”on to the core of our project.

Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of your very own Codecademy brand supermarket.

animal_counts = {
    "ant": 3,
    "bear": 6,
    "crow": 2
}
In the example above, we create a new dictionary called animal_counts with three entries. One of the entries has the key "ant" and the value 3.

Instructions
Create a new dictionary called prices using {} format like the example above.
Put these values in your prices dictionary, in between the {}:
"banana": 4,
"apple": 2,
"orange": 1.5,
"pear": 3
Yeah, this place is really expensive. (Your supermarket subsidizes the zoo from the last course.)
