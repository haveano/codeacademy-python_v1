Reassign in a Single Line
Okay! We've got the three variables we need to perform our calculation, and we know some arithmetic operators that can help us out.

We saw in Lesson 1 that we can reassign variables. For example, we could say spam = 7, then later change our minds and say spam = 3.

Instructions
On line 7, reassign meal to the value of itself + itself * tax. And yes, you're allowed to reassign a variable in terms of itself!

We're only calculating the cost of meal and tax here. We'll get to the tip soon.

# Reassign meal on line 7!

meal = 44.50
tax = 0.0675
tip = 0.15

meal = meal + meal*tax
print meal
