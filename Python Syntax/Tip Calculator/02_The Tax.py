The Tax
Good! Now let's create a variable for the tax percentage.

The tax on your receipt is 6.75%. You'll have to divide 6.75 by 100 in order to get the decimal form of the percentage. (See the Hint if you would like further explanation.)

Instructions
Create the variable tax and set it equal to the decimal value of 6.75%.
