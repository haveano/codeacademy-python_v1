The Meal
Now let's apply the concepts from the previous section to a real world example.

You've finished eating at a restaurant, and received this bill:

Cost of meal: $44.50
Restaurant tax: 6.75%
Tip: 15%
You'll apply the tip to the overall cost of the meal (including tax).

Instructions
First, let's declare the variable meal and assign it the value 44.50.
"""
# Assign the variable meal the value 44.50 on line 3!

meal = 44.50
