Escaping characters
There are some characters that cause problems. For example:

'There's a snake in my boot!'
This code breaks because Python thinks the apostrophe in 'There's' ends the string. We can use the backslash to fix the problem, like this:

'There\'s a snake in my boot!'
Instructions
Fix the string in the editor!

# The string below is broken. Fix it using the escape backslash!

'This isn\'t flying, this is falling with style!'
