String methods
Great work! Now that we know how to store strings, let's see how we can change them using string methods.

String methods let you perform specific tasks for strings.

We'll focus on four string methods:

len()
lower()
upper()
str()
Let's start with len(), which gets the length (the number of characters) of a string!

Instructions
On line 1, create a variable named parrot and set it to the string "Norwegian Blue". On line 2, type len(parrot) after the word print, like so: print len(parrot). The output will be the number of letters in "Norwegian Blue"!
"""
parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print len(parrot)
