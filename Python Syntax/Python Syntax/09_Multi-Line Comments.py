Multi-Line Comments
The # sign will only comment out a single line. While you could write a multi-line comment, starting each line with #, that can be a pain.

Instead, for multi-line comments, you can include the whole block in a set of triple quotation marks:

"""Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over,
Holy Grail.
"""
Instructions
Write a multi-line comment in the editor. It can be any text you'd like!
