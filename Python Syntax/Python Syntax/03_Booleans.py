Booleans
Great! You just stored a number in a variable. Numbers are one data type we use in programming. A second data type is called a boolean.

A boolean is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be on or off, a boolean can only be True or False.

You can use variables to store booleans like this:

a = True
b = False
Instructions
Set the following variables to the corresponding values:

my_int to the value 7
my_float to the value 1.23
my_bool to the value True
"""
# Set the variables to the values listed in the instructions!
a = True
b = False
print a, b

my_int = 7
my_float=1.23
my_bool=True

print my_int
print "\tasd"
print my_float
