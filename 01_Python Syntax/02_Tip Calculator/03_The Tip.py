The Tip
Nice work! You received good service, so you'd like to leave a 15% tip on top of the cost of the meal, including tax.

Before we compute the tip for your bill, let's set a variable for the tip. Again, we need to get the decimal form of the tip, so we divide 15.0 by 100.

Instructions
Set the variable tip to decimal value of 15% on line 5.
"""
# You're almost there! Assign the tip variable on line 5.

meal = 44.50
