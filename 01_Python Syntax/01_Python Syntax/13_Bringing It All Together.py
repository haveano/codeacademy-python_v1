Bringing It All Together
Nice work! So far, you've learned about:

Variables, which store values for later use
Data types, such as numbers and booleans
Whitespace, which separates statements
Comments, which make your code easier to read
Arithmetic operations, including +, -, *, /, **, and %
Instructions
Let's put our knowledge to work.

Write a single-line comment on line 1. It can be anything! (Make sure it starts with #)
Set the variable monty equal to True.
Set another variable python equal to 1.234.
Set a third variable monty_python equal to python squared.
"""
# to jest komentarz
monty = True
python=1.234
monty_python=python**2

print monty
print python
print monty_python
