Single Line Comments
You probably saw us use the # sign a few times in earlier exercises. The # sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that Python won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.

Comments make your program easier to understand. When you look back at your code or others want to collaborate with you, they can read your comments and easily figure out what your code does.

Instructions
Write a comment on line 1. Make sure it starts with #. It can say anything you like.
