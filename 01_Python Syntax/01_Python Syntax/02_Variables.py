Variables
Creating web apps, games, and search engines all involve storing and working with different types of data. They do so using variables. A variable stores a piece of data, and gives it a specific name.

For example:

spam = 5
The variable spam now stores the number 5.

Instructions
Set the variable my_variable equal to the value 10.
