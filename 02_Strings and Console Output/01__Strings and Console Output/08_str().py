str()
Now let's look at str(), which is a little less straightforward. The str() method turns non-strings into strings! For example:

str(2)
would turn 2 into "2".

Instructions
Create a variable pi and set it to 3.14 on line 4.
Call str(pi) on line 5, after print.

"""Declare and assign your variable on line 4,
then call your method on line 5!"""
pi=3.14

print str(pi)
