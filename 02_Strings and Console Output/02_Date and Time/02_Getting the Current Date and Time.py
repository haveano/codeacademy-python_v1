Getting the Current Date and Time
We can use a function called datetime.now() to retrieve the current date and time.

from datetime import datetime

print datetime.now()
The first line imports the datetime library so that we can use it.

The second line will print out the current date and time.

Instructions
Create a variable called now and store the result of datetime.now() in it.
Then, print the value of now.

from datetime import datetime

now =datetime.now()
print now
