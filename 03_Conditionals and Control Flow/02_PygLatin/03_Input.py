Input!
Next, we need to ask the user for input.

name = raw_input("What's your name?")
print name
In the above example, raw_input() accepts a string, prints it, and then waits for the user to type something and press Enter (or Return).

In the interpreter, Python will ask:

What's your name? >
Once you type in your name and hit Enter, it will be stored in name.

Instructions
On line 4, use raw_input("Enter a word:") to ask the user to enter a word. Save the results of raw_input() in a variable called original.
Click Save & Submit Code
Type a word in the console window and press Enter (or Return).
