Break It Down
Now let's take what we've learned so far and write a Pig Latin translator.

Pig Latin is a language game, where you move the first letter of the word to the end and add "ay." So "Python" becomes "ythonpay." To write a Pig Latin translator in Python, here are the steps we'll need to take:

Ask the user to input a word in English.
Make sure the user entered a valid word.
Convert the word from English to Pig Latin.
Display the translation result.
Instructions
When you're ready to get coding, click Save and Submit. Since we took the time to write out the steps for our solution, you'll know what's coming next!
