Compare Closely!
Let's start with the simplest aspect of control flow: comparators. There are six:

Equal to (==)
Not equal to (!=)
Less than (<)
Less than or equal to (<=)
Greater than (>)
Greater than or equal to (>=)
Comparators check if a value is (or is not) equal to, greater than (or equal to), or less than (or equal to) another value.

Note that == compares whether two things are equal, and = assigns a value to a variable.

Instructions
Set each variable to True or False depending on what you think the result will be. For example, 1 < 2 will be True, because one is less than two.

Set bool_one equal to the result of 17 < 328
Set bool_two equal to the result of 100 == (2 * 50)
Set bool_three equal to the result of 19 <= 19
Set bool_four equal to the result of -22 >= -18
Set bool_five equal to the result of 99 != (98 + 1)

# Assign True or False as appropriate on the lines below!

# Set this to True if 17 < 328 or to False if it is not.

# Set this to True if 100 == (2 * 50) or to False otherwise.

# Set this to True if -22 >= -18 or to False if it is not.
