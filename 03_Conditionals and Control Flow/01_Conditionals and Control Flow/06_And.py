"""
And
The boolean operator and returns True when the expressions on both sides of and are true. For instance:

1 < 2 and 2 < 3 is True;
1 < 2 and 2 > 3 is False.
Instructions
Let's practice with and. Assign each variable to the appropriate boolean value.

Set bool_one equal to the result of False and False
Set bool_two equal to the result of -(-(-(-2))) == -2 and 4 >= 16**0.5
Set bool_three equal to the result of 19 % 4 != 300 / 10 / 10 and False
Set bool_four equal to the result of -(1**2) < 2**0 and 10 % 10 <= 20 - 10 * 2
Set bool_five equal to the result of True and True
