Slip and Slide
Finally, you can also use the left shift (<<) and right shift (>>) operators to slide masks into place.

a = 0b101 
# Tenth bit mask
mask = (0b1 << 9)  # One less than ten 
desired = a ^ mask
Let's say that I want to turn on the 10th bit from the right of the integer a.

Instead of writing out the entire number, we slide a bit over using the << operator.

We use 9 because we only need to slide the mask nine places over from the first bit to reach the tenth bit.

Instructions
Define a function called flip_bit that takes the inputs (number, n).
Flip the nth bit (with the ones bit being the first bit) and store it in result.
Return the result of calling bin(result).

a=0b11100
b=0b11000
def flip_bit(number,n):
    mask=0b1<<n-1
    result=number^mask
    return bin(result)
print flip_bit(a,3)
print flip_bit(b,3)
