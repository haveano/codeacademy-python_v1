Lambda Syntax
Lambda functions are defined using the following syntax:

my_list = range(16)
filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, my_list)
Lambdas are useful when you need a quick function to do some work for you.

If you plan on creating a function you'll use over and over, you're better off using def and giving that function a name.

Instructions
Fill in the first part of the filter function with a lambda. The lambda should ensure that only "Python" is returned by the filter.
Fill in the second part of the filter function with languages, the list to filter.
"""


languages = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]
print filter(lambda x: x=="Python", languages)
