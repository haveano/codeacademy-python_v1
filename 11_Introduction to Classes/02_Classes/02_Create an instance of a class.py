Create an instance of a class
We can use classes to create new objects, which we say are instances of those classes.

Creating a new instance of a class is as easy as saying:

newObject = ClassName()
Instructions
Below your Car class, create a new object named my_car that is an instance of Car.

class Car(object):
    #__init__():
        pass
my_car=Car()
