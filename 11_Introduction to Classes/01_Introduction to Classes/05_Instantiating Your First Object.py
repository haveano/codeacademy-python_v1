Instantiating Your First Object
Perfect! Now we're ready to start creating objects.

We can access attributes of our objects using dot notation Here's how it works:

class Square(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.sides = 4

my_shape = Square()
print my_shape.sides

First we create a class named Square with an attribute sides.
Outside the class definition, we create a new instance of Square named my_shape and access that attribute using my_shape.sides.
Instructions
Outside the Animal class definition, create a variable named zebra and set it equal to Animal("Jeffrey").
Then print out zebra's name.
Click "Stuck? Get a hint!" for an example.
"""



class Animal(object):
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name=name

zebra=Animal("Jeffrey")
print zebra.name
