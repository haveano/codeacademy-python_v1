Classier Classes
We'd like our classes to do more than... well, nothing, so we'll have to replace our pass with something else.

You may have noticed in our example back in the first exercise that we started our class definition off with an odd-looking function: __init__(). This function is required for classes, and it's used to initialize the objects it creates. __init__() always takes at least one argument, self, that refers to the object being created. You can think of __init__() as the function that "boots up" each object the class creates.

Instructions
Remove the pass statement in your class definition, then go ahead and define an __init__() function for your Animal class. Pass it the argument self for now; we'll explain how this works in greater detail in the next section. Finally, put the pass into the body of the __init__() definition, since it will expect an indented block.

class Animal(object):
    pass
