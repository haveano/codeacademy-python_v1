While you're at it
Inside a while loop, you can do anything you could do elsewhere, including arithmetic operations.

Instructions
Create a while loop that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 squared (1, 4, 9, 16, ... , 100), each on their own line.

Fill in the blank space so that our while loop goes from 1 to 10 inclusive.
Inside the loop, print the value of num squared. The syntax for squaring a number is num ** 2.
Increment num.
"""

num = 1

while num<11:  # Fill in the condition
    print num*num# Print num squared
    num=num+1# Increment num (make sure to do this!)
