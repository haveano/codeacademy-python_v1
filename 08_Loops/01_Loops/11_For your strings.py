"""
For your strings
Using a for loop, you can print out each individual character in a string.

The example in the editor is almost plain English: "for each character c in thing, print c".

Instructions
Add a second for loop so that each character in word is printed one at a time.
"""


thing = "spam!"

for c in thing:
    print c

word = "eggs!"

# Your code here!
for x in word:
    print x
