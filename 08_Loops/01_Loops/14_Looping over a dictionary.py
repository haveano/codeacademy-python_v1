Looping over a dictionary
You may be wondering how looping over a dictionary would work. Would you get the key or the value?

The short answer is: you get the key which you can use to get the value.

d = {'x': 9, 'y': 10, 'z': 20}
for key in d:
    if d[key] == 10:
        print "This dictionary has the value 10!"
First, we create a dictionary with strings as the keys and numbers as the values.
Then, we iterate through the dictionary, each time storing the key in key.
Next, we check if that key's value is equal to 10.
Finally, we print This dictionary has the value 10!
Instructions
On line 5, print the key, followed by a space, followed by the value associated with that key.

d = {'a': 'apple', 'b': 'berry', 'c': 'cherry'}

for key in d:
    # Your code here!
    print key, d[key]
    #if d[key]==
